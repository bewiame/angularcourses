### Form validation

Angular places CSS classes on input fields based on their state.

* `.ng-valid`: value is valid
* `.ng-invalid`: value is not valid
* `.ng-pristine`: value has not been changed yet
* `.ng-dirty`: value has been changed
* `.ng-touched`: blur event has not occurred
* `.ng-untouched`: blur event has occurred
