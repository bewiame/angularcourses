### The framework

DI in Angular basically consists of three concepts:

* Dependency - The type of which an instance should be created.
* Injector - The injector object that exposes APIs to us to create instances of dependencies.
* Provider - A provider tells the injector how to create an instance of a dependency. A provider takes a token and maps that to a factory function that creates an object.

### What's really going on

Angular has a `ReflectiveInjector` responsible for instantiating objects


```ts
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([
  Car,
  Engine,
  Tires,
  Doors
]);
```

---

### What's really going on: Extended syntax

```ts
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([
  { provide: Car, useClass: Car },
  { provide: Engine, useClass: Engine },
  { provide: Tires, useClass: Tires },
  { provide: Doors, useClass: Doors }
]);
```

---

### Substitute classes

You can also give the injector instructions to substitute a certain class:

```ts
let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([
  { provide: Engine, useClass: OtherEngine }
]);
```

```ts
let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([
  { provide: Car, useFactory: () => { /* logic */ return new OtherCar(); } }
]);
```

---

### This injector is associated with a module  

The `providers` array of `NgModule` is the configuration of the injector

```ts
@NgModule({
	imports: [...],
	declarations: [...],
	providers: [ // here it is!
		CarService,
		{ provide: BookService, useClass: MockBookService }
	],
	bootstrap: [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

### One more thing

Every component gets a child injector based on the parent component's injector.

This means that:
* Every provider available in the parent component, will be available in the child component
* A child component can add or alter providers as it sees fit without affecting the parent component.
