* A powerful new application framework
* Works with the latest web standards
  * Web components and the TypeScript syntax might actually become native web components and pure JavaScript  
* But not limited to just the browser: NativeScript/Ionic
* Great performance
* Broad tooling support (Node.js, Visual Studio Code extensions)
* Already a big community
