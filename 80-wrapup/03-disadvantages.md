### Disadvantages of Angular

* Changes happen fast, your process needs to accomodate this
* It's completely new, so no easy upgrade from AngularJS
  * There's an `ngUpgrade`, but that alone is a lot of work
  * Users are reconsidering whether they really want to switch to Angular. What about ReactJS or aurelia or Polymer? 
* Exceptions, though a stacktrace is generally nice, are currently pretty awful
